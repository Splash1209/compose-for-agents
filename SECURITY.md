# Security Policy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

This repository contains demo applications for educational purposes. **DO NOT use default configurations in production environments.**

## Security Guidelines

### üîí Before Running Any Demo

1. **Change ALL default passwords** before running any compose configuration
2. **Never commit secrets** to version control
3. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
4. **Review network exposure** of all services

### üõ°Ô∏è Required Security Steps

#### 1. Database Security
- **MongoDB**: Set strong `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable
- **MySQL**: Set strong `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable
- **Never use default passwords** like "password" or empty passwords

#### 2. API Keys and Tokens
- Copy `.env.template` files to `.env` in each demo directory
- Set your actual API keys in `.env` files
- Ensure `.env` files are in `.gitignore` (they are by default)

#### 3. Network Security
- Database ports are exposed for demo purposes
- In production: Use internal networks, no exposed ports
- Consider using Docker secrets for production deployments

#### 4. File Permissions
- Ensure secret files have restricted permissions (600)
- Review volume mounts for sensitive data exposure

### üö® Never Commit These Files

- `.env` files with real credentials
- `secret.*` files
- API key files
- Database dumps or backups
- Private keys or certificates

### üîç Security Checklist

Before sharing or deploying:

- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in files
- [ ] Environment variables used for sensitive config
- [ ] .env files excluded from git
- [ ] Database credentials are strong (16+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- [ ] Network access reviewed and restricted as needed

### üìä Demo vs Production

| Aspect | Demo Configuration | Production Configuration |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Passwords | Environment variables | Strong, rotated regularly |
| Network | Exposed ports for testing | Internal networks only |
| Secrets | Local .env files | Container orchestration secrets |
| TLS | Often disabled | Always enabled |
| Monitoring | Basic logs | Full security monitoring |

### üêõ Reporting Security Issues

If you find security vulnerabilities:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Contact the repository maintainers privately
3. Provide detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Allow time for fixes before disclosure

## Supported Versions

This repository contains demonstrations and examples for multi-agent systems using
various agent frameworks. Security updates are provided for the current `main`
branch and the most recent stable releases of each demo.

| Component | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| main branch | :white_check_mark: |
| Latest demos | :white_check_mark: |
| Docker configurations | :white_check_mark: |
| Archived/legacy demos | :x: |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the agent demos or
configurations, please help us maintain the security of the project by reporting
it responsibly.


### Where to Report

**For security vulnerabilities, please use GitHub Security Advisories:**

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Splash1209/compose-for-agents/security)
   of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with details about the vulnerability

**For less critical security concerns, you can:**

- Open a regular issue on GitHub (for configuration recommendations, best practices, etc.)
- Contact the maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Location**: Which demo/component is affected
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to resolve the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment and triage within **5 business days**
- **Updates**: Regular updates every **7 days** until resolution
- **Resolution**: We strive to resolve critical vulnerabilities within **30 days**

### What to Expect

**If the vulnerability is accepted:**

- We'll work with you to understand and reproduce the issue
- We'll develop and test a fix
- We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
- We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)
- We'll update affected demos and documentation

**If the vulnerability is declined:**

- We'll provide a detailed explanation of why it doesn't qualify as a security issue
- We may suggest alternative channels (like feature requests) if appropriate
- We'll still thank you for your security research efforts

### Security Best Practices

Since these are demo applications, please remember:

- **Never use demo configurations in production** without proper security hardening
- **Review all Docker configurations** before deploying in your environment
- **Use secure API keys and secrets management** in production deployments
- **Keep your Docker installation and dependencies up to date**
=======
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.


## Security Considerations for Agents

When developing and deploying agent-based applications, several security considerations must be taken into account:

### Input Validation

All input to agents should be properly validated and sanitized:

- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize data received from external sources
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use allowlists for acceptable input formats where possible

### Authentication and Authorization

Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented:

- Use strong authentication methods
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Data Protection

Sensitive data must be properly protected:

- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper key management
- Use secure communication protocols
- Regularly backup sensitive data

### Network Security

Network communications should be secured:

- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use VPNs for sensitive communications
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### Container Security

When using containerized deployments:

- Use minimal base images
- Regularly update container images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper container isolation
- Use read-only filesystems where possible

### Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging:

- Log all security-relevant events
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerting for security incidents
- Regularly review security logs
- Implement centralized logging

### Third-party Dependencies

Manage third-party dependencies securely:

- Regularly update dependencies
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency pinning
- Monitor for security advisories
- Implement software composition analysis

**Remember: These are demo applications. Always implement proper security measures for production use.**
