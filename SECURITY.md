# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

## Security Considerations for Agents

When developing and deploying agent-based applications, several security considerations must be taken into account:

### Input Validation

All input to agents should be properly validated and sanitized:

- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize data received from external sources
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use allowlists for acceptable input formats where possible

### Authentication and Authorization

Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented:

- Use strong authentication methods
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Data Protection

Sensitive data must be properly protected:

- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper key management
- Use secure communication protocols
- Regularly backup sensitive data

### Network Security

Network communications should be secured:

- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use VPNs for sensitive communications
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### Container Security

When using containerized deployments:

- Use minimal base images
- Regularly update container images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper container isolation
- Use read-only filesystems where possible

### Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging:

- Log all security-relevant events
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerting for security incidents
- Regularly review security logs
- Implement centralized logging

### Third-party Dependencies

Manage third-party dependencies securely:

- Regularly update dependencies
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency pinning
- Monitor for security advisories
- Implement software composition analysis

**Remember: These are demo applications. Always implement proper security measures for production use.**
